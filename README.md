# Personal-Diary-Management-System
Here, I have made a 'Personal Diary Management System' using C language. In this project, user can keep their personal record like they do in a diary. You can keep records of the important things what you do in your daily life.
File handling has been effectively used to keep the records.
In this application, you can add, view, edit and delete records. Records can be added with many information such as address, time and date.


The basic user-defined functions used in this project are listed below :-
int insert()      to insert records in diary
int add()         it is used to add new data in previously inserted record.
int viewrecord()   to view added record in list
